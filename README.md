# Calculator With Decent UI

if ur reading this i just want to tell u to check the code its very much able to tell what it does but heres the small rundown 

- simple -,+,*,/ counting to decimals
- change the number from -7 to 7 and otherway around via the +/- button
- made the Clear button so if u have already counted ur stuff u just hit it once all goes away but if u messup    mid writing u can click the numbers off one by one
- + Added an currency changer.
- next i might add an feature to count diffrend stuff like triangles and such and also might work more on the UI to make it more cleaner
