# Calculator With Decent UI

if ur reading this i just want to tell u to check the code its very much able to tell what it does but heres the small rundown 

- simple -,+,*,/ counting to decimals
- change the number from -7 to 7 and otherway around via the +/- button
- made the Clear button so if u have already counted ur stuff u just hit it once all goes away but if u messup mid writing u can click the numbers off one by one
- thats all for now might come back and add more stuff in near future
